### âŒ‘ Hey there! âŒ‘

I make small tools for developers, starter projects, and am on the Vue.js core team. I'm also VP of Developer Experience at Netlify, a company that makes it quick and straightforward to deploy sites. I'm also a staff writer for CSS-Tricks, and wrote a book on SVG Animations from O'Reilly. I'm a Frontend Master: I have courses on Vue.js, SVG Animation, and Design for Developers.

If you like my work you can sponsor me through [GitHub sponsors.](https://github.com/sponsors/sdras)

ðŸ¥‚ Cheers!

I make tools for developers, projects, and am on the Vue.js core team. I'm also VP of Developer Experience at Netlify, a company that makes it quick and straightforward to deploy sites. I'm also a staff writer for CSS-Tricks, and wrote a book on SVG Animations from O'Reilly. I'm a Frontend Master: I have courses on Vue.js, SVG Animation, and Design for Developers, all of the materials of which are open sourced here.
